## Hi! I'm Zach 
I am a self-taught software developer. I switched to programming after completing an M.A. specializing in Swedish History.

I enjoy taking apart algorithms and heuristics to see how they work and figure out how to apply them to something completely different. Currently I am into plugging whatever code I am working on into Compiler Explorer to see what is really going on under the hood with complier optimizations.

Now I am seeking to get into a job where I can get feedback from experienced developers, improve my knowledge with real-world projects, and learn creative engineering solutions to real challenges.
